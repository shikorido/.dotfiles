# UPD. Backticks do not escape everything like in regular shell pass without quotes.
#      In my tests, backticks make $, \, ` escapable if not surrounded by double quotes
#      (single quote is not considered escapable thus backslash remains, the same stays for any non-escapable character).
#      If backticks are surrounded by double quotes the behavior changes slightly.
#      Now backticks surrounded by double quotes make $, \, `, " escapable which means my previous tests below may be wrong in terms of
#      amount of backslashes used.
#      Single quotes have no additional behavior and therefore behave similar (or identical) to non double quoted case ($, \, `).
#
# So how can we test that non-escapable characters do not trigger backslash exhaustion in backticks escaping passes? Here it is.
# Single quotes are still respected by outer shell pass thus everything inside stay literal after backticks escaping passes.
printf "%s\n" `printf %s '\\\1'`  # \\1
printf "%s\n" `printf %s '\''_'`  # \_
printf "%s\n" `printf %s '\"'`    # \"
printf "%s\n" "`printf %s '\"'`"  # "
#
# Also note that double quotes change escapable characters only if outer shell sees double quotes.
# In other words, the following has identical output cause backslash does not escape ".
printf "%s\n" `printf %s_%s \"\`printf %s \"1\"\`\"`   # ""1""_
printf "%s\n" `printf %s_%s \"\`printf %s \\"1\\"\`\"` # ""1""_
#
# The important quirk is that outer shell notifies only relevant backticks layer whether it is wrapped in double quotes.
# We could think that if outer backticks are surrounded by double quotes
# then any inner backticks will inherit that behavior and consider double quote as escapable character.
# However, this is not the case:
# Both backticks layers are surrounded by raw ".
printf "%s\n" "`printf %s \\""\`printf %s \\\\"\`"`"  # ""
# Only outer backticks layer is surrounded. Looks fine, right?
printf "%s\n" "`printf %s \\"\`printf %s \\\\"\``"    # ""
# However, it can be simplified. Lets look how the previous line is processed in general.
# 1. Outer backticks (wrapped in ") pass gives \\" from \\\\" inside inner backticks.
# 2. Inner backticks (not wrapped in ") pass gives \" from \\"  inside its own backticks layer.
# 3. Outer shell finalizes backticks layers from innermost to outermost.
#    Escapes everything depending on context (with or without quotes),
#    performs expansions, collects words from quotes,
#    invokes corresponding command in substitution.
# Look at step 2 again. In my assumption, double quotes
# only change escaping behavior for backticks they wrap.
# Inner backticks are not wrapped, thus \" should stay as-is cause " would be considered non-escapable.
# Which leads to:
printf "%s\n" "`printf %s \\"\`printf %s \\"\``"      # ""
# 1. Outer backticks (wrappend in ") pass gives \" from \\" inside inner backticks.
# 2. Inner backticks (not wrapped in ") pass gives \" from \" inside its own backticks layer (the same behavior would apply for inner backticks layers).
# 3. Thus, outer shell handles \" as escape (look at 041,0,z example below, shell will try to escape everything if no double quotes in play)
#    and passes raw " to a corresponding command.
#
# To be explained. Just a couple tests.
