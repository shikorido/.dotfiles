diffs between
reg add "REG_PATH" /ve /d "powershell -Command Start-Process \"\\\"alacritty\\\"\" -ArgumentList '--working-directory',\"\\\"`\\\"%%V.`\\\"\\\"\" -Verb RunAs"
and
reg add "REG_PATH" /ve /d "powershell -Command Start-Process \"\\\"powershell\\\"\" -ArgumentList '-noexit','-command','Set-Location','-literalPath',\"\\\"\`\\\"%%1\`\\\"\\\"\" -Verb RunAs"

1. In registry.
powershell -Command Start-Process "\"alacritty\"" -ArgumentList '--working-directory',"\"`\"path with '.`\"\"" -Verb RunAs

powershell -Command Start-Process "\"powershell\"" -ArgumentList '-noexit','-command','Set-Location','-literalPath',"\"\`\"path with '.\`\"\"" -Verb RunAs

2. Invocation.
2.1. WinAPI CreateProcess pass from context menu click.
powershell -Command Start-Process "alacritty" -ArgumentList '--working-directory',"`"path with '.`"" -Verb RunAs

powershell -Command Start-Process "powershell" -ArgumentList '-noexit','-command','Set-Location','-literalPath',"\`"path with '.\`"" -Verb RunAs

2.2. PowerShell's pass before WinAPI's CreateProcess for Start-Process (WS = word start, WE = word end).
WSalacrittyWE WS--working-directoryWE WS"path with '."WE WS-VerbWE WSRunAsWE

WSpowershellWE WS-noexitWE WS-commandWE WSSet-LocationWE WS-literalPathWE WS\"path with '.\"WE WS-VerbWE WSRunAsWE

2.3. The final CreateProcess call.
WSalacrittyWE WS--working-directoryWE WSpath with '.WE WS-VerbWE WSRunAsWE

WSpowershellWE WS-noexitWE WS-commandWE WSSet-LocationWE WS-literalPathWE WS"path with '."WE WS-VerbWE WSRunAsWE
